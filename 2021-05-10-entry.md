I'm from St.Joseph, MI.  I'm a senior at Grand Valley and I don't currently have a job.  I love to cook and I also love collecting houseplants.
I have very little knowledge on the learning modules.  This is my first time using this type of programmng but I do have a little bit of programming background.
