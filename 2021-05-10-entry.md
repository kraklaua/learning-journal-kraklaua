I'm from St.Joseph, MI.  I'm a senior at Grand Valley and I don't currently have a job.  I love to cook and I also love collecting houseplants.
I have very little knowledge on the learning modules.  This is my first time using this type of programmng but I do have a little bit of programming background.
I'm excited to see how R compares to what I already know how to do.
I don't think there's any considerations to be aware of.
